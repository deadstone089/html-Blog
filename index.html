        Try to move the mouse on different elements. The structure will be highlighted and you will
        be able to see the different inclusions of elements one in each other. If you move the 
        cursor to this sentence, it will be highlighted in dark grey, showing the presence of an
        &lt;article&gt; element, surrounded by a &lt;section&gt; element (light grey), etc. So we have some 
        articles in a single section element. The page title at the top is a &lt;header&gt; element, 
        while the tag cloud on the right is a &lt;aside&gt; element. The main menu on top (with Blog, 
        About, Contact) is a &lt;nav&gt; element.

        Fig. 1 : an example of how new structuring elements could be used. This page put a &lt;nav&gt; on top, and does not have headers and footer for each article, like in this figure, but it could... By the way, this is a &lt;figcaption&gt; inside a &lt;figure&gt; element...

        Work on HTML 5 originally started in late 2003, as a proof of concept to show that it was possible to extend HTML 4's forms to provide many of the features that XForms 1.0 introduced, without requiring browsers to implement rendering engines that were incompatible with existing HTML Web pages. At this early stage, while the draft was already publicly available, and input was already being solicited from all sources, the specification was only under Opera Software's copyright.
        </p>
        <p>
        In early 2004, some of the principles that underlie this effort, as well as an early draft proposal covering just forms-related features, were presented to the W3C jointly by Mozilla and Opera at a workshop discussing the future of Web Applications on the Web. The proposal was rejected on the grounds that the proposal conflicted with the previously chosen direction for the Web's evolution.
        </p>
        <p>
        Shortly thereafter, Apple, Mozilla, and Opera jointly announced their intent to continue working on the effort. A public mailing list was created, and the drafts were moved to the WHATWG site. The copyright was subsequently amended to be jointly owned by all three vendors, and to allow reuse of the specifications.
        </p>
        <p>
        In 2006, the W3C expressed interest in the specification, and created a working group chartered to work with the WHATWG on the development of the HTML 5 specifications. The working group opened in 2007. Apple, Mozilla, and Opera allowed the W3C to publish the specifications under the W3C copyright, while keeping versions with the less restrictive license on the WHATWG site.
        </p>
        <p>
        Since then, both groups have been working together.
